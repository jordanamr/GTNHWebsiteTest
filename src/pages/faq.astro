    question: "What launcher should I use?",
    answer:
      "GT:NH is availiable through Technic Launcher, CurseForge and Prism. While the first two launchers are convenient, they both have their own quirks, so the GT:NH Team strongly advise you to use Prism, as you will also be able to benefit from better performances if you install the Java 17-25 archive.",
  },
  {
    question: "Which Java version should I use?",
    answer:
      "We recommend <b>Java 17-25</b> for current releases. If you must use legacy setups, <i>Java 8</i> builds are also available.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do I install the pack?",
    answer:
      "Download our Prism archive from the Downloads page, then drag and drop the archive on the Prism launcher. That's it!",
  },
  {
    question: "Where can I get help?",
    answer: "You can join our Discord and ask in the support channels, or try our wiki.",
